# GoLua

Implementation of Lua in Go.

# Quick start

To install, run:

```sh
$ go get github.com/arnodel/golua
```

To run interactively (in a repl):

```
$ golua
> function fac(n)
|   if n == 0 then
|     return 1
|   else
|     return n * fac(n - 1)
|   end
| end
> -- For convenience the repl also evaluates expressions
> -- and prints their value
> fac(10)
3628800
> for i = 0, 5 do
|   print(i, fac(i))
| end
0	1
1	1
2	2
3	6
4	24
5	120
>
```

To run a lua file:

```sh
$ golua myfile.lua
```

Or

```sh
cat myfile.lua | golua
```

E.g. if the file `myfile.lua` contains:

```lua
local function counter(start, step)
    return function()
        local val = start
        start = start + step
        return val
    end
end

local nxt = counter(5, 3)
print(nxt(), nxt(), nxt(), nxt())
```

Then:

```sh
$ golua myfile.lua
5	8	11	14
```

Errors produce useful tracebacks, e.g. if the file `err.lua` contains:

```lua
function foo(x)
    print(x)
    error("do not do this")
end

function bar(x)
    print(x)
    foo(x*x)
end

bar(2)
```

Then:

```
$ golua err.lua
2
4
!!! error: do not do this
in function foo (file err.lua:3)
in function bar (file err.lua:8)
in function <main chunk> (file err.lua:11)
```

## Aim

To implememt the Lua programming language in Go, easily embeddable in
Go applications.  It should be able to run any pure Lua code

## Design constraints

* clean room implementation: do not look at existing implementations
* self contained: no dependencies
* small: avoid re-implementing features which are already present in
  the Go language or in the standard library (e.g. garbage collection)
* register based VM
* no call stack (continuation passing)

## Components

### Lexer / Parser

* The lexer is implemented in the package `scanner`.
* The parser is hand-written and implemented in the `parsing` package (it used
  to be generated from `lua.bnf` using gocc (https://github.com/goccmack/gocc).
  The command used was: `gocc -no_lexer lua.bnf`.  I have left the grammar in
  for now.)

### AST → IR Compilation

The `ast` package defines all the AST nodes. Each node in the AST
knows how to compile itself using an `ir.Compiler` instance.

The `ir` package defines all the IR instructions and the IR compiler.

### IR → Code Compilation

The runtime bytecode is defined in the `code` package.  Each IR
instruction (see package `ir`) know how to compile itself using an
`ir.InstrCompiler` instance.

### Runtime

The runtime is implemented in the `runtime` package.  This defines a
`Runtime` type which contains the global state of a runtime, a
`Thread` type which can run a continuation, can yield and can be
resumed, the various runtime data types (e.g. `String`, `Int`...). The
bytecode interpreter is implemented in the `RunInThread` method of the
`LuaCont` data type.

### Test Suite

There is a framework for running lua tests in the package `luatests`.
In the directory `luatests/lua`, each `.lua` file is a test. Expected
output is specified in the file as comments of a special form,
starting with `-->`:

```lua
print(1 + 2)
--> =3
-- "=" means match literally the output line

print("ababab")
--> ~^(ab)*$
-- "~" means match with a regexp (syntax is go regexp)
```

There is good coverage of the standard library but more tests need to
be written for the core language.

### Standard Library

The `lib` directory contains a number of package, each implementing a
lua library.

* `base`: basic library. It is done apart from `xpcall` (and the
  implementation of `load` is not complete).
* `coroutine`: the coroutine library, which is done.
* `packagelib`: the package library.  It is able to load lua modules
  but not "native" modules, which would be written in Go. Obviously
  this is not part of the official Lua specification. Perhaps using
  the plugin mechanism (https://golang.org/pkg/plugin/) would be a way
  of doing it.  I have no plan to support Lua C modules!
* `stringlib`: the string library.  It is complete.
* `mathlib`: the math library,  It is complete.
* `tablelib`: the table library.  It is complete.
* `iolib`: the io library.  It is implemented apart from `popen`,
  `file:setvbuf`, `read("n")` (reading a number)
* `utf8lib`: the utf8 library.  It is complete.

The following libraries do not exist at all:
* os library
* debug library (I don't know how much of this can reasonably be
  implemented as I didn't want to be constrained by it when designing
  golua)
